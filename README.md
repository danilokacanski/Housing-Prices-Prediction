# Housing-Prices-Prediction
A machine learning project focused on predicting housing prices in California using various features like location, median income, and population density, utilizing the Kaggle dataset.

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict housing prices in California using the Kaggle dataset. The dataset includes key features such as median income, population, proximity to the ocean, and house location coordinates. The model was developed using data preprocessing techniques like handling missing values and scaling features, followed by implementing algorithms such as linear regression and decision trees. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like RMSE to optimize predictions.
